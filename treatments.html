        <p>All patients will have a full examination at least twice a year. At these appointments the dentist will take a dental history, check your mouth for any signs of tooth decay, gum disease, problems with missing teeth or dentures and many other dental problems. They will also check that the soft tissues in your mouth appear healthy. This is also an opportunity for you to ask advice on any worries you may have about your oral health. </p>

        <p>The practice offers the full range of NHS dental treatments such as a scale and polish, fillings, extractions and dentures to replace missing teeth. Veneers, crowns and bridges are also available on the NHS. </p>

        <p>We also offer a number of private treatments not covered by the NHS, such as tooth-coloured fillings and crowns on back teeth and tooth whitening. Your dentist can discuss the treatment options available to you at your check-up appointment. </p>

        <p>Our hygienist has worked at the practice for nearly a decade, and helps patients to maintain a clean mouth and healthy gums. Patients can have up to four scaling appointments per year under the NHS, if required. </p>

        <p>We are also part of the Childsmile Programme, where we help support families to promote good oral health in their children through oral hygiene and diet advice, provision of toothbrushes and age-appropriate toothpaste, and application of fluoride varnish to help strengthen teeth. We can also provide fissure sealants for a child's adult molars, where a protective layer is applied to help prevent decay in these vulnerable teeth. </p>

        <p>For patients who require specialist treatments such at orthodontic treatment to straighten teeth, removal of wisdom teeth or treatment under sedation, we can refer you through our trusted referral pathways to access the appropriate service. </p>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p> Once you are registered with the practice, if you have a dental emergency such as severe pain, swelling, bleeding or trauma, we guarantee to offer you an appointment during our normal working hours within 24 hours. If you require emergency treatment when the practice is closed, such as evenings, weekends and public holidays, you can call NHS 24 <a href="http://www.nhs24.com"> http://www.nhs24.com </a> on 111, and they will arrange for you to be treated at the Glasgow Dental Hospital if emergency care is required. </p>

      <div class="panel-heading"> Paying for Treatment </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>All dental check-ups are free of charge. If you require any further treatment, your dentist can advise you of the estimated cost and discuss treatment alternatives. Many people will automatically qualify for free NHS dental treatment on the basis of age, if you receive certain benefits, or if you are pregnant or a new mother. Our reception team will advise you of which circumstances entitle you to treatment free of charge. A list of the exemptions can be found here <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/03/30092604/46"> http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/03/30092604/46 </a></p>

        <p>Fees for NHS dental treatment are set by the Scottish Executive and as such are the same in every dental practice in Scotland. We ask that payment be made at each appointment for the work carried out on that day, and we accept cash, cheque or credit/debit card. </p>
